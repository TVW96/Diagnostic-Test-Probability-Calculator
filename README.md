# Diagnostic-Test-Probability-Calculator

### **Objective:**
Design and implement an application that allows a user to input the prevalence of a disease, the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, and the specificity of the test. The application will then compute and display the probability of the disease given the test result.


## The application contains input fields for the following:

#### **Prevalence** (P(Disease)):
The proportion of the population that has the disease.

#### **Sensitivity** (P(Test+|Disease+)):
The probability that the test is positive given that the person has the disease.

#### **Specificity** (P(Test-|Disease-)): 
The probability that the test is negative given that the person does not have the disease.
